reconcile local and global axis
quaternion?

local is two axis, left right up down.
global is three axis xyz

vextor travels down Z
up moves to x or y
left moves to x or y

rotations x y z
can be one of 4 values 0, 64, 128, 192



vector travels increasing or decreasing on an Axis.
<>^ and v act on two axis perpendicular to the axis the vector is travelling on.

say vector starts on increasing x-axis and up is decreasing z axis
a down rotation makes
